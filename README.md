# Pairs Trading Strategy  

**Project Overview:**  
This project showcases a quantitative approach to pairs trading, utilizing historical price data from HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank. Pairs trading is a market-neutral strategy that capitalizes on temporary mispricings between two related stocks. By employing statistical tests and Python programming, the project analyzes the dynamics of these stocks, identifies potential trading signals, and evaluates the strategy through backtesting.  

**Motivation:**  
Driven by a strong interest in quantitative trading and the complexities of financial markets, I pursued this project to delve into pairs trading, a strategy particularly well-suited for the volatile Indian stock market. This endeavor enabled me to apply my expertise in Python programming, statistical analysis, and machine learning to real-world financial data.  

**Technologies Used:**  
The project is developed using Jupyter Notebook and leverages libraries such as pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, statsmodels, and yfinance to ensure efficient data processing, analysis, and visualization.  

**Key Features:**  
- **Data Retrieval:** Automates the process of fetching historical stock data using the yfinance API.  
- **Exploratory Analysis:** Conducts cointegration tests and creates visualizations to explore the relationship between the selected stocks.  
- **Strategy Development:** Implements a fully documented pairs trading strategy using Python.  
- **Backtesting:** Evaluates the strategyâ€™s performance and profitability based on historical data.  

This project demonstrates my skills in quantitative finance, statistical analysis, Python programming, and strategy backtesting.
